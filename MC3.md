# MINI CHALLENGE: The Travel Bag

You're packing for a trip! You have a tuple that stores the items you're taking.
CREATE A NEW FILE CALLED travel.py
1. Create a tuple called "travel_bag" with at least 5 items(ex. "shirt","socks"...)
2. print the SECOND and FOURTH items in your bag.
3. Check if "shoes" is in your travel bag- if it is, print "You are ready to walk!" otherwise
   print " you forgot your shoes!!!"
4. Make a new tuple calles "essentials" with 3 must-have items.
5. Combine both tuples into one called "final_bag"
6. Print how many total items you now have using len()
7. print the last item in your "final_bag"

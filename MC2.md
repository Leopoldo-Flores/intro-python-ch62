MINI CHALLENGE: STUDENT REPORT CARD
# You need to store and analyze a student's grades.
# Create a new file called student_report.py
1. Create a dictionary called "report_card" with keys:
   -"name"
   -"subject"
   -"grades": (90, 85, 88) 
2. Print student's name and subject.
3. Calculate the average of the 3 grades (HINT: use sum() and len() )
4. Add a new key called "average" with the calculated result.
5. If the average is 90 or above -> print "excellent"
    if between 70 and 89 -> print "good job"
    otherwise -> print "needs improvement!"
6. Remove the "subject" key and print the updated dictionary
